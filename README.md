# The Cat Who Programmed The World

The Cat Who Programmed The World.... 

Sometimes when I'm working on my mechanical keyboard, Simon joins me and watches me work.  Sometimes, he seems to also deliberately input()s his "ideas" into the computer.  Of course I think this is adorable, and encourage him.

Lovingly copied and pasted into a .txt file, Old Man Simon (who really, is old enough to by Yoda) now has is very own Github repo!  

These are 100 percent authentic from the paws of the cat.
